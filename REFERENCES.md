- (SmashRun)[https://smashrun.com]
  Web app, aggregator for running data
  - Good:
    - Central hub for data (easy to export to, and fetch from)
    - Public URL for users and specific runs
  - Bad:
    - Ugly (of course, subjective)
    - Limited analysis possible
    - Analysis ("N fastest, X longest") does not take type of run, or intention, into account

- (Vi)[https://www.vi-labs.com/vitrainer/]
  Running app
  - Good:
    - Guided runs
    - Training plans built-in
    - Incentive during run
    - Feedback during run (e.g., on speed, cadence etc)
  - Bad:
    - Cannot add your own runs / plans
    - Cannot share or export data
    - Is it even still supported / developed?

- (Runkeeper)[http://runkeeper.com/]
  Running app
  - Good:
    - Easy to simply start a run
  - Bad:
    - Cannot easily export or share data
