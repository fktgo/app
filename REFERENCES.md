  Web app, aggregator for running data
  - Good:
    - Central hub for data (easy to export to, and fetch from)
    - Public URL for users and specific runs
  - Bad:
    - Ugly (of course, subjective)
    - Limited analysis possible
    - Analysis ("N fastest, X longest") does not take type of run, or intention, into account

  Running app
