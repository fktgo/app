The goal of FKTGo is to make going for a run as simple as possible.

This means simply going for a run should be trivially simple (a push of a button, at most),
whereas more complex scenarios (say, an interval run, or one of longer training plan, or a run with)
some audio cues based on heart rate and other on speed) should be made easy.
